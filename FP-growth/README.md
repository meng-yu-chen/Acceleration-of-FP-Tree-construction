# FP-growth
This repository contains a C++11 implementation of the well-known FP-growth algorithm, published in the hope that it will be useful. I tested the code on three different samples and results were checked against [this other implementation](http://www.borgelt.net/fpgrowth.html) of the algorithm.

The files `fptree.hpp` and `fptree.cpp` contain the data structures and the algorithm, and `main.cpp` contains a few tests.

Compile the code using the appropriate options for C++11 (e.g. `-std=c++11` using g++).


### branch - jett 

* Use OpenMP to parallelize the FP-tree construction

* Parallelize the process by dividing it into two parts:        
    * Build frequency item set
    
    * Tree construction

#### How to run the code

* If you are using Docker, just follow the instructions below

    ```bash
    # Build the Docker image and create the container
    docker-compose up 

    # Navigate to the FP-growth directory
    cd FP-growth

    # Remove all compiled files
    make clean

    # Compile the program
    make

    # Run the parallel code on the dataset
    ./main
    ```

* If you are not using Docker, please ensure that your environment supports OpenMP and g++, then follow the instructions below

    ```bash
    # Navigate to the FP-growth directory
    cd FP-growth

    # Remove all compiled files
    make clean

    # Compile the program
    make

    # Run the parallel code on the dataset
    ./main
    ```
