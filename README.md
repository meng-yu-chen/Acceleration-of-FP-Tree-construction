# Acceleration-of-FP-Tree-construction

This repository contains a C++11 implementation of the well-known FP-growth algorithm, published in the hope that it will be useful. I tested the code on three different samples and results were checked against [this other implementation](http://www.borgelt.net/fpgrowth.html) of the algorithm.

The files `fptree.hpp` and `fptree.cpp` contain the data structures and the algorithm, and `main.cpp` contains a few tests.

Compile the code using the appropriate options for C++11 (e.g. `-std=c++11` using g++).


### branch - jett 

* Use OpenMP to parallelize the FP-tree construction

* Parallelize the process by dividing it into two parts:        
    * Build frequency item set
    
    * Tree construction

#### How to run the code

* If you are using Docker, just follow the instructions below

    ```bash
    # Build the Docker image and create the container
    docker-compose up 

    # Navigate to the FP-growth directory
    cd FP-growth

    # Remove all compiled files
    make clean

    # Compile the program
    make

    # Run the parallel code on the dataset
    ./main -t {number_of_threads}
    ```

* If you are not using Docker, please ensure that your environment supports OpenMP and g++, then follow the instructions below

   * First: change the data file directory(data_folderPath) in main.cpp 

   * Then
       ```bash
       # Navigate to the FP-growth directory
       cd FP-growth
   
       # Remove all compiled files
       make clean
   
       # Compile the program
       make
   
       # Run the parallel code on the dataset
       ./main -t {number_of_threads}
       ```

### branch - cuda

* Use CUDA to parallelize the FP-tree construction

* Parallelize the process by dividing it into four parts:        
    * FPTransMap
    * FPRadixTree
    * FPHeaderTable
    * FPGrowth

#### How to run the code

 ```bash
       # Navigate to the FP-growth directory
       cd FPtree-cuda
   
       # Remove all compiled files
       make clean
   
       # Compile the program
       make

      # Run the parallel code on simple dataset
       ./tree ./dataset/test.txt

       # Run the parallel code on the dataset
       ./tree {dataset.txt}       
 ```
dataset:
   igh_100.txt
   low_100.txt
   uniform100.txt
   low_50.txt
   high_50.txt
   uniform50.txt
